Hello Everyone 
I would like to request some help about littlefs.

I have liltlefs running on nRF7002DK board on the external 
SPI flash memory. With Flash SHELL enable I am able to read
the file system sectors. I would like to use JLINK read of load the 
file system into the flash but I couldn't find the external flash memory
address. 
I followed this tutorial from Golioth but it uses NXP frdm_rw612 board 
but I doesn't provide more detail on how to find the address for different board.

If someone can point me in the right direction I would really appreciate it.
